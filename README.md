Course Recommendation System
Introduction
This project is a course recommendation system that suggests relevant courses based on similarity scores calculated using natural language processing techniques. The system is designed to recommend courses from a given dataset, considering various factors such as course content, organization, and subject.

Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

Dataset: The dataset used for this project is loaded from a CSV file (coursera_course_data.csv).

Data Exploration and Analysis: Initial exploration and analysis of the dataset are performed using Python and popular data science libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values and create new features. Text data from different columns is concatenated to form tags for each course.

Feature Extraction: The tags are transformed into numerical vectors using Count Vectorization to prepare the data for similarity calculation.

Similarity Calculation: Cosine similarity is employed to calculate the similarity between courses based on their tags.

Recommendation Function: A recommendation function is implemented to suggest courses similar to a given course. The function considers both overall similarity scores and top-rated courses within the same organization and subject.

How to Use
To use the course recommendation system, follow these steps:

Install Dependencies: Make sure you have the required Python libraries installed. You can install them using the following:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn nltk
Run the Jupyter Notebook: Execute the Jupyter Notebook (course_recommendation_system.ipynb) to load, analyze, and preprocess the dataset, as well as to train the recommendation system.

Test the Recommendation Function: Test the recommendation function by calling it with a specific course title. For example:

python
Copy code
recommend('IBM Data Science')
This will provide a list of recommended courses based on similarity and top-rated courses within the same organization and subject.

Additional Notes
The recommendation system utilizes cosine similarity to measure the similarity between courses.

Text data is preprocessed by removing unnecessary characters and applying stemming using the NLTK library.

The project also includes visualizations to explore the distribution of course ratings and other relevant insights.
